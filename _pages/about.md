## Professional career
Matthias is a passionate data scientist and software engineer specializing in the biomedical field, where he combines his zeal for discovery with a meticulous scientific approach. His professional ethos is deeply rooted in the search for real positive insights, guided by a rigorous procedure where interpretations are supported by solid analysis to ensure that conclusions are both convincing and reproducible. This ability to lead projects to success is built on a foundation of technical and statistical expertise, an understanding of scientific principles and a commitment to authenticity. His goal is to ensure that biomedical research advances healthcare and paves the way for better patient outcomes worldwide.

After his studies in Bioinformatics (BSc) at the University of Tübingen and Business Informatics (MSc) at the University of Braunschweig, he pursued his dissertation ([Link][dissertation-link]) as part of a scientific collaboration between Prof. Arne Schäfer of the Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Sciences at the Charité – University of Berlin and Prof. Jeanette Erdmann († 2023) to identify novel risk loci for aggressive and chronic periodontitis. In 2019, he received his doctoral degree (Dr. rer. nat.) from the Free University of Berlin. Subsequently, he worked as Postdoc at the group for Medical Systems Biology, University of Lübeck, led by Prof. Hauke Busch.

During his time in academic research he worked on the detection of correlations to illuminate (epi)genetic causalities and pathomechanisms of common and rare diseases by analyzing various kinds of high-throughput (aka OMICs) data. In doing so, he complemented available in-silico methods by own algorithms and data integration approaches ([Genehopper][genehopper], [Qtlizer][qtlizer] [[R/Bioconductor]][r-bioc], MouseFM [[R/Bioconductor]](https://doi.org/doi:10.18129/B9.bioc.MouseFM), Polygenic Risk [ZEIT article][zeit-article]).

In summer 2020, Matthias Munz left acadamia to pursue a position as bioinformatics scientist in biomarker research at Roche in Penzberg.
