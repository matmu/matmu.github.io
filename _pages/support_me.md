title: Hi there!
---

I’m a passionate bioinformatician who loves creating tools for the bioinformatics community. I develop R packages ([MouseFM](https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/MouseFM.html) and [Qtlizer](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/Qtlizer.html)) and webservers ([Genehopper](http://genehopper.de)) that are open to everyone, completely free to use. These tools aim to make bioinformatics research more accessible and efficient.

Maintaining these resources, including paying for the backend server, is something I currently handle on my own. As the community grows, so do the costs and time commitment involved.

If you’ve found my work helpful or use any of the tools I’ve developed, I would greatly appreciate your support! Even a small contribution helps me keep everything running smoothly and continue improving these resources.
