## Troubleshooting

If you have a question about using Jekyll, start a discussion on the [Jekyll Forum](https://talk.jekyllrb.com/) or [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/jekyll). Other resources:

- [Ruby 101](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/ruby-101/)
- [Setting up a Jekyll site with GitHub Pages](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/github-pages/)
- [Configuring GitHub Metadata](https://github.com/jekyll/github-metadata/blob/master/docs/configuration.md#configuration) to work properly when developing locally and avoid `No GitHub API authentication could be found. Some fields may be missing or have incorrect data.` warnings.


## Customization
- Page is based on template at [https://github.com/mmistakes/mm-github-pages-starter](https://mmistakes.github.io/mm-github-pages-starter/)
- [Documentation](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/quick-start-guide/)
- Not all theme files are included in the repo directly but are used from the Gem. To make changes on missing files, copy them from [here](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes) to the repo and Jekyll will prefer the local copy
- `academicicons.css` (contains Google Scholar icon) stylesheet included by adding it to `_includes/custom.html`
- Typography reverted back to older versions by adding stylesheets referencing fonts in `_includes/custom.html` and overriding SASS variables from `_sass/minimal-mistakes/_variables.scss` in `assets/css/main.scss` before `@import` statements (Instructions [here](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/stylesheets/))
- Changed font size and family of sidebar (and more) by overriding CSS statements from `_sass/minimal-mistakes/_sidebar.scss` in `assets/css/main.scss` after `@import` statements
- Adjusted `_includes/seo.html` such that the title of the landing page (Recent posts, defined in `index.html`) does not contain redundant parts (i.e. `Matthiasmunz.de - Matthiasmunz.de` becomes `Matthiasmunz.de`)
